## P - Polynomial time problems

Problems which can be solved in polynomial time. Like MergeSort algorithm.

## NP - Non-deterministic Polynomial time problems

Problems which might not be solved in Polynomial time but can be verified in polynomial time.

## NP-complete

Problems which are as hard as NP and are NP problems. Every NP problem can be converted to NP-complete in polynomial time.

## NP-hard

Problems which are as hard as NP but might/might not be NP problems. Every NP problem can be converted to NP-hard in polynomial time. 

## Hierarchy:

```
P ⊆ NP ⊆ NP-complete ⊆ NP-hard ⊆ All problems
```
