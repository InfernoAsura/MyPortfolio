# Greetings

Hi there! I'm Aditya Mundhara ðŸ‘‹, a student pursuing my B.Tech. in Artificial Intelligence & Data Science at IIT Jodhpur.

I'm deeply interested in the fascinating world of Computer and want to learn as much as I want. I have a keen interest in fields like development, AI, ML/DL, networking, game development, and hacking. For now, I only have a bit of knowledge in some of the above fields.

<!--You'll find my [latest articles](/pages/posts.html) where I write about AI, machine learning, data science, and my academic experiences. I also share information about my [projects](/pages/projects.html) and research work.-->


Also check out my [CV] if you want to know more about my experience.

Feel free to [reach out](/pages/contact.html) if you'd like to connect, collaborate, or just have a chat about technology and innovation!
