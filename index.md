# Greetings

Hi there! I'm Aditya Mundhara ðŸ‘‹, a student pursuing my B.Tech. in Artificial Intelligence & Data Science at IIT Jodhpur.

I'm deeply interested in the fascinating world of AI and data science, where I combine theoretical knowledge with practical applications. Through this website, I share my journey, insights, and experiences in these cutting-edge fields.

You'll find my [latest articles](/pages/posts.html) where I write about AI, machine learning, data science, and my academic experiences. I also share information about my [projects](/pages/projects.html) and research work.


Also check out my [CV] if you want to know more about my experience.

Feel free to [reach out](/pages/contact.html) if you'd like to connect, collaborate, or just have a chat about technology and innovation!
